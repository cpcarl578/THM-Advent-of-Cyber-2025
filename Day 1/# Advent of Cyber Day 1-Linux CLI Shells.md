### Takeaways

One of my recent favorite skills that I have learned prior to the Advent of Cyber is using the Linux CLI so this by far was an awesome first day. I learned how to use the "cat"  and "find" commands. I already had previous knowledge of finding hidden files so this made it a little easier on the challenges today! I attempted to complete the sidequest and it was taking me way to long to figure out I did however find one the three flags for this challenge and will most likely come back and attempt to complete the sidequest with a fresh mind.
