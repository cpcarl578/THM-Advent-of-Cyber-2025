Note about code:
- CC BY-SA is a content-oriented license and can be applied to source code, but it is not a typical software license. If you expect others to reuse code in closed-source projects or in contexts where standard software licenses (MIT, Apache-2.0, GPL-3.0) are expected, consider dual-licensing or placing code under a permissive software license (for example, MIT) while keeping writeups, images, and other creative content under CC BY-SA 4.0.
- If you'd like that option later, say "Please add MIT for code" and I will prepare the MIT LICENSE and a README snippet explaining which directories are covered by which license.
