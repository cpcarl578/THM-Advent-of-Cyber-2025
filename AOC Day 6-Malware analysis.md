#  Malware Analysis- Egg-xecutable


## Objectives

1. The princples of malware analysis
2. An introduction to sandboxes
3. Static vs. Dynamic analysis
4. Tools of the trade: Pestudio,Procmon,Regshot





### Skills Learned/Lessons learned

- Regshot
- Procmon- exposure
- Sandbox-exposure

### Tools Used

- Platform used to learn- TryHackMe
- Regshot
- Pestudio
- Procmon

## Flags

- THM{STRINGS_FOUND}
 
### Practical Portion

1. Start the attackbox
2. open Pestudio 
3. drag and drop HopHelper.exe 
4. go to indicators tab
5. find the SHA256SUM
6. go to strings tab and locate the First flag for today and that is THM{STRINGS_FOUND}
7. conclude our static investigation
8. Open Regshot and read about how it works on THM website
9. Change the output path to desktop
10. Take the first shot of the registry as it currently is and take a screenshot of the registry for myself and this repo SCREENSHOT HERE PLEASE
11. Run the executable malware 
12. Notice many of the Icons on my shortcut change and received a windows message that "King Malhare sends his regards"
13. Click ok on the windows message
14. Go back to Regshot and click second shot
15. Regshot runs the second shot 
16. We are able to than click compare and this opens notepad so we can see the data
17. Use CTRL+F and we can search and type hophelper
18. Find where the executable has added itself to the run key
19. Exit Regshot and open Procmon (Process Monitor)
20. Start the recording in Procmon
21. Run the hophelper.exe
22. Filter to process name contains hophelper
23. look at all the data in the system
24. Apply another filter operation contains TCP add that filter
25. analyze the data and notice that the malware is communicating because we send, receive,connect, and disconnect,
26. Close procmon I did not do the sidequest at this point hoping to come back later when time allows.



## Takeaways

This was a harder room for me as I am still learning and have not done much with the tools that were used today. It was nice to have some basic exposure to these tools and have a walkthrough to see what we need to be looking for when using them. The coolest part to me was getting to run a malware on a sandbox and see how this can change a system without doing any damage to a machine that I  use daily!
