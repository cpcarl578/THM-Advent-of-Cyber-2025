## Takeaways from todays room

It was cool to see and use Microsoft Azure. It has a very visual dashboard with tons of data to look at, this makes it very easy to search and review incidents. One of the features is that it uses priority flags and than explains how the system detected an incident in process making it very easy to navigate and understand as a beginner. The massive amount of data and different tables and windows all on one screen was a little overwhelming at first but I enjoyed looking at the different flagged incidents and seeing the many different ways you can interrupt the data.
