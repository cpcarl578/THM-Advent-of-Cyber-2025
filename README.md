#### Learning a new concept in Cybersecurity every day until christmas!




##### A few of the concepts that are being covered by TryHackMe
- OSINT
- LINUX CLI
- Web attack forensics
- Malware Analysis
- Social Engineering
- AWS security
 
##### Other Concepts I am learning everyday for Writeups.
- Markdown syntax (using this to complete write ups)
- GitHub 






## __Why did I make this Repository ?__
I have been very focused on learning  the fundamentals of  cybersecurity and have not displayed much of what I have learned so far in 2025. During the AOC 2025 I am taking this oppurtunity to learn  use  of GitHub to provide writeups, screenshots, and lessons learned everyday as well as review my understanding of the concepts. I also hope someone else out there is encouraged by this Repo to start learning and continue learning daily. 




## __What will be in this repository?__
I will be providing  write ups using Markdown syntax, Screen shots, Screen recordings,  thoughts, and lessons learned to build my online portfolio and demonstrate my continued learning and passion for cybersecurity.
