## Takeaways from todays room

I really enjoyed analyzing the emails for phishing or spam today.This is something that I think everyone should have some firsthand knowledge of! Most phishing emails and texts have effected most of us or someone we know whether it be an annoyance or convincing them that the phishing attempt is legitimate. Phishing plays on the human element and social engineering can convince someone that they need to provide more information than they should.
