## Objectives

There were four main objectives of this lab. The first objective was to learn how to ingest and interpt log data using Splunk. I than moved on to learning  how to create and apply custom field extractions to aid me in filtering through log data results. Using search processing language I was able to filter and refine the multiple results shown. The final objective was to put everything I learned previously into motion and conduct an investigation using splunk. 


### Skills Learned

- Basic use of splunk
- Exposure to Search processing language
- Detect anomalies using various filters and SPL (Search processing language)
- Navigation of some of the various fields of data

## Tools Used

- SPLUNK
- Platform used to learn- TryHackMe

## Flags 
- No flags for today.


## Takeaways


In this lab I was able to use SPLUNK for the first time and was exposed to the processing language that is used to properly refine log results. This was my first time ever using a SIEM tool so it took me a lot longer than previous labs to complete. I have gained a very basic understanding of how SPLUNK works and will continue learning how to use it as well as SPL. I enjoyed being able to refine massive amounts of log files and determine some anomalies of a network.
